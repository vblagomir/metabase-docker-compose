## Preparing
First, you need to create `.env` file;
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, you need to change passwords at `.env` file. Do not forget adjust `JAVA_TIMEZONE` environment according to your timezone. You should also adjust `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL` variable with your email.

## Run
```
docker-compose up -d
```

and then point to `localhost:3000`. It may take couple of minutes to get a response until containers are up and running. You may use PgAdmin4 in case needed from `localhots:3001`.

## Roadmap
- [ ] MongoDB setup at the start
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Clustering?
- [ ] Inject sample data
